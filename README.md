# Welcome to SobieskiSat Main repository
## What is SobieskiSat?
We are a group of students from the II High School in Krak√≥w. We got qualified for the CanSat competition, which is organised by the ESERO. Our mission is to build a can-sized atmospheric probe. The objective of CanSat competition is to develop a lot of small probes which can be used for scientific research and advancing technology.

## What is your mission?
Our mission is to build and launch a can-sized atmospheric probe, which will be equipped with basic sensors like temperature, humidity and  pressure, and also with more advanced modules like an air quality meter. In our project we also use advanced GPS positioning and RF communication using LoRa protocol.

## Repository Structure
SobieskiSat is a complex project that requires work in many fields including software, electronics, 3D-Design. That's why we divied this repository into a few directories:
  -['docs'](docs/) - project documentation
  -['graphics'](grapics/) - graphical design
  -['models'](models/) - 3D designs
  -['diagrams'](diagrams/) - visual conecpts design
